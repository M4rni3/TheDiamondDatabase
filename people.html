				<p>Meet the cast of this hilarious reality show that is called life with 10-DIAMOND. Read up on all of our personality quirks and weird stuff that each and every one of us does. Keep in mind that stuff within quotes ("") are straight of the words or writing of the person. We like to keep things authentic.</p>
